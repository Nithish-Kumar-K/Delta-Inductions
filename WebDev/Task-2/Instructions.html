					<h1>THE MILLENIUM FALCON</h1>
          <div id="intro">
              Captain Solo and his friend Chewbacca are trapped in a direlict space station. They are surrounded by innumerable
							obstacles and must successfully navigate their way out of this station. Worse, as the station is about to explode,
							they need to keep increasing their speed and evade the obstacles at the same time.
              <br/><br/>
							However, Captain Solo has one thing to his favour- Speed Capsules. Speed Capsules can warp reality around the space
							of the Millenium Falcon and can move it through the obstacle for a short distance. But, the Speed Capsules are limited and can be
							regenerated only after the Falcon moves through certain distance.

							Guide the Falcon through this satellite for the Captain.

        <h1>CONTROLS:</h1>
				  <div id="controls">
	          <p>
	            UP ARROW: Provides an upward acceleration for the Falcon. Note that since it's acceleration and not velocity, the
							movement need not be instantaeous. Also as there is no friction the ship keeps moving in y direction till you manually
							bring it down to 0 velocity<br/>
							DOWN ARROW: Provides a downward acceleration for the Falcon.<br/>
							ENTER: Pause/Play the game. Press Enter to start the game at first<br/>
							P: Play again<br/>
							I: Instructions<br/>

              Take care of collision against the walls of the station, due to lack of gravity you will rebound from the surface.
							The number of speed Capsules and score are displayed in the bottom of the screen.
